As the agents move                   around on the landscape they metabolize some of their existing                   sugar. The agents are constantly looking for new sugar, and                   when they find it they add it to their resources. If the agents                   ever eat all of their sugar, then they will die. If they get                   enough sugar, then they can reproduce. Each agent has a random                   value for its metabolism, initial quantity of sugar, and vision                   level (that controls how far around it can look for more sugar).                   The sugar itself can grow back at different rates. For a more                   thorough description of Sugarscape, check out the Sugarscape                   web site (<a href="http://www.brook.edu/SUGARSCAPE/">http://www.brook.edu/SUGARSCAPE</a>).&nbsp;</font></font></td>              </tr>              <tr BGCOLOR="#FFFFCC">                 <td><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size=-1>How                   to Use It</font></b></font></td>              </tr>              <tr VALIGN=TOP>                 <td>                   <table BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=5 CELLPADDING=0 WIDTH="100%" >                    <tr>                       <td VALIGN=TOP><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size=+0>Click                         the SETUP button to setup the agents (red).

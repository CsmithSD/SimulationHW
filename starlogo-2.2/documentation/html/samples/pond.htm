The red turtles and green turtles get along with one another. But each turtle wants to make sure that it lives near some of &quot;its own.&quot; That is, each red turtle wants to live near at least some red turtles, and each green turtle wants to live near at least some green turtles. The simulation shows how these individual preferences ripple through the pond, leading to large-scale patterns. This project was inspired by Thomas Schelling's writings about social systems (such as housing patterns in cities).</font></td>

The turtles move around until there is at most one turtle on a patch. Click go to start the simulation synchronously (or use tgo to start the turtles moving independently). If turtles don't have enough same-color neighbors, they jump to a nearby patch.</font></p>

The happypct slider controls the percentage of same-color turtles that each turtle wants among its neighbors. For example, if the slider is set at 30, each green turtle wants at least 30% of its neighbors to be green turtles.</font></p>

It starts at about 0.5, since each turtle starts (on average) with an equal number of red and green turtles as neighbors. The unhappy-turtles monitor shows the number of turtles that have fewer same-color neighbors than they want (and thus they want to move).</font></p>

But in the new locations, they might tip the balance of the local population, prompting other turtles to leave. If a few red turtles move into an area, the local green turtles might leave. But when the green turtles move to a new area, they might prompt red turtles to leave that area.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Over time, the number of unhappy turtles decreases. But the pond becomes more segregated, with clusters of red turtles and clusters of green turtles.</font></p>

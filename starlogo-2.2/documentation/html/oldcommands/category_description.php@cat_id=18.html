<div class="catdescription">
StarLogo supports only a few data types: Booleans, Lists, Numbers, and Strings.

There are two booleans, <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>. There are no numeric equivalents to true and false (such as 1 or 0). They must be referred to by name (or by executing a logical operator (<code>=, not=, <, >, <=, >=</code>).

A <code>[list of data]</code> is a data list, similar to a list in other versions of
Logo. Unlike other Logo languages, however, StarLogo does not enable you to
execute a list of data as an instruction (that is, there is no run
command). You can create a list of data using the list or sentence
commands, or by enclosing the literal elements in <code>[]</code>'s. (e.g. setfamily
[my mother is nice]). You can create an empty list using <code>[]</code>. No elements
inside the <code>[]</code>'s are evaluated.
Note: In this version of StarLogo turtles, patches, and the observer can
access a list of data.

In StarLogo, numbers have a range that is determined by the version of Java
that you are using. In Sun's Java this ranges from approximately -1*10^300
to 1*10^300, and decimals can go down to about 1*10^-300. Values smaller
than 1*10^-300 return a value of 0, and values larger than 1*10^300 return a
value of "Infinity".

Strings are used to refer to filenames and other strings. Strings are
written as a string with a quotation mark " at the beginning and the end
(e.g. <code>"foo"</code> or <code>"myfile.txt"</code>).

<div class="catdescription">
These are all the commands that affect properties of a turtle. A turtle has several built-in properties: <code>xcor</code>, <code>ycor</code>, <code>color</code>, <code>heading</code>, <code>shape</code>, <code>breed</code>, <code>who</code>, pen position (up or down) and whether or not the turtle is visible. Additional properties may be declared by you, with the <code>turtles-own</code> command. </div>

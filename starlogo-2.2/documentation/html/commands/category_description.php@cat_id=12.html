Here are a list of commands that affect lists. Note that these commands are only for lists of data. Lists of data are linked data lists, similar to lists in other versions of Logo. Unlike other Logos, however, StarLogo does not enable you to execute lists of data as instructions (that is, there is no run command). You can create a list of data using the list or sentence commands, or by enclosing the literal elements in <code>[]</code>'s. No elements inside the <code>[]</code>'s are evaluated.</div>

Challenge 3: Big Bumper Turtles  
In this project the turtles change direction every time they bounce off of an "obstacle". Depending on the color of the obstacle, the turtle will turn either to the right, to the left, or all the way around.  

If you are having trouble visualizing the difference between turtles and patches, this project is a particularly good example to explore. In this project, the patch size (and therefore the turtle size too) is larger. All of the obstacles are only a single patch big, and the turtles only walk in the cardinal compass directions.   

Click the "setup" button to set up the turtle in its initial  position. Then click the "go" button to start the simulation.  By using the "pen-down" and "pen-up" buttons you can control whether or not the turtle marks the path that it follows by drawing on the patches with its pen. To erase the turtle's path use "clear-path", which clears only the yellow path drawn by the turtle.  

As you are exploring this project, try using the "clear-graphics" button and then drawing your own obstacles. You can do this by  using the Paint Tools as described in Challenge 2. Just remember that in the check-patches procedure, the turtles only look for red, green, and blue obstacles (colors 15, 55, and 105 respectively).

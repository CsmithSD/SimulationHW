Announcing the release of StarLogo 2.2

Hello StarLogo Users.

We are pleased to announce the much anticipated release of StarLogo
2.2.  This is mostly a maintenance release in which we have fixed some
bugs.  This is (really) likely to be the final release of StarLogo as
you know it, as we expect a preview of an entirely new version in the
very near future.

Below you will find detailed descriptions of the new features and bug
fixes since our last release.

You can download StarLogo from the new StarLogo web site at
http://education.mit.edu/starlogo.

Enjoy!	
The StarLogo Team

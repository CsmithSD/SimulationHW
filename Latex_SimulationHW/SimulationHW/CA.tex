\section{Problem: Slides 1}
\textbf{ Modify the heat flow example to deal with insulated conditions on the top and bottom boundary. Insulation means zero flux or u[N][j] = u[N-1][j]. This implies that instead of a fixed valued ghost points on the top and bottom, you modify the CA rule using the previous relation. }


\section{Problem: Slides 2}
\textbf{ Reproduce patterns theta, lambda, mu, alpha in the Gray-Scott Model (CA). You don't need to follow their color scheme. }
